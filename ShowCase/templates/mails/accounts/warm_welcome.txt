Hi,

I am Rohit, Co-Founder of ThirdDime. I saw that you have recently created an account, thanks for giving ThirdDime a shot.

You are part of our very first audience, that makes you special for us.

We promise to try our best to show you the most unique content around art which is a result of our effort to understand how we actually percieve artworks.

But this mission is at fail if we are not able to help you bring forth your thoughts.

It is a humble request, take a look at artworks at ThirdDime and let them evoke thoughts in you.
And while these thoughts are running wild, put them in a 'Series'.

It's a rather fun experience, as I have been told.

Worst case, you'll end-up with a collection of your views.

Welcome to ThirdDime.

Thanks,
Rohit
